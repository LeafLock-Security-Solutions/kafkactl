### Disclaimer

This project is not an official Apache Kafka or Apache Software Foundation (ASF) project. We are a community of developers passionate about making Kafka more accessible and user-friendly. Our goal is to provide a helpful tool that simplifies the development workflow and administration for Kafka users.

### The Problem

While Apache Kafka is a robust and powerful platform, its command-line interface and version management can be challenging for both new developers and experienced operators. Tasks such as switching between different Kafka versions for testing, managing multiple running instances, and remembering complex command-line arguments can slow down development and introduce friction.

---

### The Solution

`kafkactl` provides a unified and intuitive interface to address these challenges. It acts as a version manager and wrapper for Kafka, inspired by tools like `nvm` (Node Version Manager) and `gvm` (Go Version Manager). The `kafkactl` installation provides two main commands:

* **`kvm` (Kafka Version Manager):** A command for managing your Kafka installations. Use it to install, list, and switch between different versions.
* **`kafka`:** A command for interacting with a Kafka cluster. It simplifies common operations, such as starting and stopping brokers or managing topics.

This two-command approach allows you to focus on building applications and managing data streams, not on the tedious details of Kafka administration.
